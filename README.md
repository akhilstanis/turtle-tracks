## Description

Logo is a programming language created mainly for educational purposes in 1967. It is probably best known for Turtle graphics. These are drawings created using a on-screen cursor - often represented by a turtle icon - whose movements are controlled by a set of simple commands.

The two main attributes of the turtle are position and orientation. Its movements are always relative to its current position, while the direction is determined by the turtle's orientation. For example, a command such as "forward 10" will move the turtle 10 units from its current position and in the facing direction. To make the turtle face in a different direction, you'd have to issue a command like "left 90". The number 90 refers to the angle that the turtle should pivot by, which in this case would be 90 degrees counterclockwise.

Your task is to write a Logo-like program that is capable of producing ASCII art. You will be provided with an input file containing a list of commands which when parsed and executed should produce an ASCII drawing.
